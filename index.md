# Welcome Adventurers! 

You are about to join a homebrew text-only server where you will take on bounties West Marches style, meet hundreds of new people, and live out an epic life of an adventurer. 

## Who We Are
> - The largest text-based D&D living world!
> - Friendly community that welcomes and teaches newbies
> - The world is in a homebrew medieval fantasy setting
> - West Marches style server: There is no set plot, and a party changes for each DM event. However, the games are scheduled and run by multiple volunteer DMs with sign-ups from players

> - Not a voice chat (VC) game server
> - Not a Looking for Group (LFG) server
> - Not a shared setting with any partner servers
> - Not in Forgotten Realms setting
> - Not affiliated with AL (Adventurer’s League) in any way. No XP can be transferred to/from AL


## What We Do
> - 24/7 Active and family-friendly Roleplays
> - Games in Live text sessions
> - Mobile-friendly text games
> - Google Sheet maps (Not VTTs)

> - No campaigns: We roleplay with our characters living in this world, and play one-shots that your characters join as “bounties”. You do not need to form your own party.

## A Few Words
> - We would appreciate it if you would take the time to read the `#rules` if you haven't already. Every rule is there for a reason.
> - Please refer to `#character-creation-rules` for accepted books and UA/Homebrew. Our staff team is here to help you should you have any problems or questions along the way, so don't be afraid to ask for help in `#server-questions`

> - If you don’t think DW is what you are looking for, you may find something that better suits your taste in our `#partner-servers`.



This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.

[^1]: [It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site).
