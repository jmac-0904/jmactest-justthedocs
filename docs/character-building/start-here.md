## Server Rules for Character Creation

Character creation rules can be found in `Character Creation Rules`.

## Stats/Gold/HP

It is entirely optional to roll for stats/gold/hp. However, once you have made the rolls, you must use the rolled results.

- All rolls must be made in `⁠#official-character-rolls` for it to be valid.

### Stats
> You may use Standard Array / Point Buy / Rolling for the character stats.
> - For rolling, use !rollstats in `#official-character-rolls`.
> 
> You are only permitted one roll per character, and the command will give you stats that are to our server's minimum standard.
> 
> {: .important }
Do not roll stats on DnD Beyond! You cannot use Standard Array/Point Buy after rolling. You can switch to rolling from Standard Array/Point Buy if you are still in the character creation stage.

### Gold
To roll for gold, follow the instructions pinned in `#official-character-rolls`. Please note that if you roll for gold, you cannot take equipment or gold from your class or background.

> You may take starting equipment or roll for gold.
> - If you choose to take starting equipment, the item must be available in the regular market. The market document can be found here: [DW Snowhaven Market](https://docs.google.com/document/d/131lUJSH1DX0FLMfKKlO9irCnfG6zjwbjjG5-HKstWsU/)
> 
> Once you have rolled the gold and imported your sheet in `#character-sheets`, you may then purchase the equipment in the #`transaction-log`. The market document is linked in `#advanced-play-rules`.

### HP

> We recommend that you choose fixed value HP as described in PHB. You may choose to roll HP following the instructions pinned in `#⁠official-character-rolls`.
