# New to D&D

## Step-by-Step: Making your first character on DnD Beyond

### Getting Started
> - Make a D&D Beyond account if you don’t already have one: https://www.dndbeyond.com/create-account
> - Go to "Create a Character"
> - Choose "Standard" Character Creation Method
> - Check "Show Help Text". This gives you overview of various D&D concepts that are useful for creating a character.
>
> You could use "Quick Build" as well, which will make a generic character for you.

> Read the help texts. As you go through the help texts, if anything is unclear or confusing, please direct your questions to `#⁠beginner-help`.
